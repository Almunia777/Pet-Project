#### PET--PROJECT ####

This was my first attempt to work on a Web-App
The idea of this project was to make an E-commerce website,
dedicated for selling pets.
However I was still learning and could not make the project dynamic.
But through this project I learnt database managment, and how 
databases work with web applications.

This project helped me learn the following features:

1.) Working with MySQL database on a Node.js server.
2.) User authorization and authentication.
3.) Making a simple search bar for fetching data from database.
